# Project 1: [TMDb Movie Dataset Data Analysis](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002-alg-t2/parts/cd0000/modules/306f0239-bb80-45c6-bf45-37ee745a63d6/lessons/ls0526/concepts/8301984f-672a-4a93-8dd3-fb771c95d044)

This is a project I did for my ALX Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I analysed the TMDb Movie Dataset using the budget and revenue columns in the dataset.

* Data was taken from the TMDb movies dataset which contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

* Question(s) for Analysis
What is the lowest and highest profit earned in the movies released?
What years had the highest revenue?
